# Getting Started with Machine Learning

## Basic Algorithms
- **Supervised Learning**: Implement algorithms like:
  - **Linear Regression**: Predict a continuous value.
  - **Logistic Regression**: Predict binary outcomes.
  - **Decision Trees**: Understand tree-based models.
- **Unsupervised Learning**: Explore algorithms like:
  - **K-Means Clustering**: Group similar data points.
  - **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**: Reduce dimensionality.

## Work on Projects
  - Apply what you learn in small projects:
  - Create a simple linear regression model to predict housing prices.
  - Build a classification model using a dataset (like Iris or Titanic).
  - Participate in Kaggle competitions to practice with real datasets.

## Dive Deeper into Advanced Topics
  - **Deep Learning**: Learn about neural networks, frameworks like TensorFlow (Python) or C++ APIs.
  - **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**: Understand text data processing and models.
  - **Reinforcement Learning**: Study algorithms that learn through interaction with the environment.
